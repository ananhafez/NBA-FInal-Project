Growing up in Los Angeles, I loved going to Lakers games with my dad, watching them win two championships in a row, and buying as many Kobe Bryant jerseys as my parents would let me. I even played in a YMCA basketball league and my team won the championship! (Would you believe that?) Over the years though, I've seen a massive shift the way basketball is played. Every kid now wants to be like Steph Curry, shooting from super far away and repeatedly making it. In recent years, teams are allegedly taking many more 3-point shots than when I was a kid and point totals are rising becuase of it. Games that used end with with 80 or 90 points now regularly end with over 100, 110, and sometimes 120 points. In fact, there have already been a few games in the most recent season that have ended with 150+ points! I wanted to test this theory with R. Are players really taking more 3-point shots than ever before, and how does that affect other parts of professional basketball? The three-point shot, as many fans know, was not always in the game. When Wilt and Russell used to play, each field goal counted as two points and free throw one. In the 1979-1980 season, the NBA adopted the three-point line, further from which, a shot would count as 3 points. This change, undeniably, has changed the game to head to toe. Hopefully, with many visualizations and (finally) clean code, I can see how and why professional basketball has changed in the past few decades. "

Additionally, though 31 states have not outlawed the death penalty, less than 10 actually conducted any executions thsi year. This reaffirms some of the statements made in the Medium articles that discuss death penalty being more of a de factor life sentence in most states.   Sentiment Analysis begins on the Most Common Words tab which shows that a majority of the words in Last Statements are connote positivity and/or trust. The word cloud below shows that one of the most common words in Last Statements by the subjects was the word good with 55 entries.  The time plot is inconclusive. However, it does show that the percentage of positive words used has increased at a higher rate than the percentage of negative words used. "

Curry's top 6 points per shot distance come form behind 3-point line. In fact, Curry scores more per shot on average 30 feet from the basket than 10 feet. To someone unfamiliar with basketball, this might not make sense. Steph Curry makes shots 10 feet away 67% of the time and 30 feet away only 45% of the time.
